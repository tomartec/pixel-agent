## What It Does

- Shows Paperclip agents walking around a multi-room pixel office.
- Moves working agents toward desks and idle agents toward lounge, kitchen, boardroom, and games areas.
- Supports multiple camera views across the office layout.
- Includes assignable character sprites so each agent can have a consistent look.
- Expands the original pixel-agent style into a denser company view for larger Paperclip teams.

## Development

Paperclip should be running before installing or testing the plugin locally. The plugin needs the Paperclip host to load the worker, serve the UI bundle, and expose the plugin bridge.

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Typecheck:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
```

Build:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

The build output is written to `dist/`.

## Assets

Character sprites live in:

```text
public/assets/characters/
```

Add new sprites as `char_81.png`, `char_82.png`, etc. The build script auto-detects `char_*.png` files and adds them to the plugin asset index.

## Ready-Made Paperclip Companies
